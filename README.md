This is a two dimensional pathway analysis of mouse RNA-seq data. 

Reads were previously mapped with Salmon to the mouse transcriptome from Gencode (version vM24).

In this analysis I use DESeq2 for DE analysis and Mitch for 2D pathway enrichment.

Gene sets were obtained from Reactome and converted to mouse using previously written bash script.

The analysis was conducted in R version 4.0.2.
