This is a two dimensional pathway analysis of mouse RNA-seq data. 

Reads were previously mapped with Salmon to the mouse transcriptome (Ensembl version 99).

In this analysis I use DESeq2 for DE analysis and Mitch for 2D pathway enrichment.

Gene sets were obtained from Reactome and converted to mouse using previously written bash script.
